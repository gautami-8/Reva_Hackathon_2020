Our project is develped using machine learning
During pandemic COVID-19, WHO has made wearing masks compulsory to protect against this deadly virus so we are developing Real-time Face Mask Detector with Python.
We will build a real-time system to detect whether the person on the webcam is wearing a mask or not,This will be very useful in public places like Malls,movie theaters etc
