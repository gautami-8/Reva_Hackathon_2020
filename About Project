During pandemic COVID-19, WHO has made wearing masks compulsory to protect against this deadly virus so we are developing Real-time Face Mask Detector with Python.
We will build a real-time system to detect whether the person on the webcam is wearing a mask or not,This will be very useful in public places like Malls,movie theaters etc
In this project, we will build a model to detect whether a person is wearing mask in real-time. We will do this using the concepts of computer vision using the OpenCV library and Keras
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning in artificial intelligence (AI) that has networks capable of learning unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabeled.
